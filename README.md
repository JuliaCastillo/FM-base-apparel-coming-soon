## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

 - This was my first time learning about and using grid. It was a challenge but by working on this project I learned a lot.
 - Practiced the use of rem and em units.
 - Practiced mobile-first development.



### Continued development

I still don't understand how they made the background on the original design.


### Useful resources

These two resources helped me to start with grid:

- [A Complete Guide to Grid | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/)
- [Look Ma, No Media Queries! Responsive Layouts Using CSS Grid](https://css-tricks.com/look-ma-no-media-queries-responsive-layouts-using-css-grid/)
